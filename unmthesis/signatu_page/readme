This directory contains the two files needed to create your own signature page 
which  will exactly match  your thesis or  dissertation.  Simply place sig.tex
and unmthesis.sty in your directory, make appropriate  changes to the  sig.tex
file, and execute "latex sig.tex".   FINALLY, PRINT THIS  OUT ON A RED  BORDER
PAGE (available here or the OGS home page).

RED BOX PAGES:  Use  either redbox.pdf  or redbox.ps  for blank red box pages.
-------------   In  conjunction with the 'nobox' option  in  your  thesis, you
                can print  title and abstract  title on  these sheets.  Better
                yet, turn  on 'final' option in your  thesis to  print red box
                directly (see styles manual, page 2).

                Also, use a blank redbox for the LaTeX signature page (it will
                NOT create the red box automatically.
 
The files in this directory are as follows:

sig.tex:       Your custom signature title  page file.  All  you need to do is 
               change your  name, department, and paper type (either thesis or
               dissertation).
unmthesis.sty: The associated style file  that is called  automatically by the
               sig.tex document.
redbox.pdf,
redbox.ps:     Use either of these  to produce a blank page with only  the red
               border box.
