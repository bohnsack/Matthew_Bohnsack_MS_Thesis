TODO:
    - Read about sequence diagrams
    - Create some sequence diagrams for how the envisioned service could work
    - Put some of this new stuff into a presentation, working towards giving a
      presentation on next Friday's research group meeting
    - read Fowler reference
    - read more in dynamic programming book
    - learned about synctex - should get this going on Linux with vim+evince:
      http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/2941/how-to-setup-synctex-with-vim-pdflatex-and-an-open-source-pdf-viewer-under-linux
      http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1716268
    - download and read CCREL references from http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_REL
    - write in presentation about current limitations with CC more rights model
    - write in presentation about sequence diagram
    - get information about google and yahoo (and maybe bing) search for CC-licensed content
    - checkout http://www.expono.com/ which is a sort of flickr alternative
    - checkout vimeo for CC stuff
    - some of my text on license discriptions in my old CC presentation comes
      from a CC source that isn't cited.  Need to find exact source and provide
      citation, if similar words/descriptions are used in final
      paper/thesis/presentation.
    - literature search for CC compliance checking tools (there probably are some)
    - Have Makefile automatically take Inkscape SVG and convert it to PDF on
      the command line and have these conversions be a dependency for rebuild
      of top-level projects.
Mon 2011-08-15:
    * Start implementing LaTeX document parser
    * Add code directory for implementation
Sun 2011-08-14:
    * Add compliance checking tool diagram and more progress on presentation outline
    * Change usecase diagrams to work with \multiinclude{}, so we have animation like stuff on a single slide number
Sat 2011-08-13:
    * Add two usecase flows to presentation
    * Add diagrams for usecase2, including step-by-step PDFs
    * Make multiple layers for usecase1 and add step-by-step PDFs
Sun 2011-08-07:
    - more work on use cases (see below)
    - Created Inkscape SVG/PDF usecase diagram for usecase #1
Sat 2011-08-06:
    - some use cases:

Item                          | Value

Use-case name:                | Compliance Checking CC-Licensed LaTeX Document
                              | Which is Mixed with Other CC-Licensed Content
------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
Brief description:            |
------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
Actor(s) involved:            | 1. Primary author (creating LaTeX document)
                              | 2. Image owner 1 (image mixed into LaTeX document)
                              | 3. Image owner 2 (image mixed into LaTeX document)
                              | 4. Image owner 3 (image mixed into LaTeX document)
------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
Basic flow of events:         | 1. The primary author downloads multiple CC-licensed
                              |    image files from the web for mashup in a new
                              |    LaTeX file that will also be CC-licensed with
                              |    a license that may be of a different type
                              |    than the ones associated with the images.
                              | 2. The primary author annotates LaTeX file to note
                              |    the type of CC license that it is intended
                              |    the be licensed under.
                              | 3. The primary author runs a compliance checking tool
                              |    on their LaTeX document to determine if their
                              |    intended license is compatible in a mash-up
                              |    with the images that are included within it.
                              | 4. The compliance checking tool reports to the
                              |    primary author that the document's intended
                              |    license is compatible with with the CC-licensed
                              |    images that are included within it.
------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
Alternate flow(s) of events:  | 1. The primary author downloads multiple CC-licensed
                              |    image files from the web for mashup in a new
                              |    LaTeX file that will also be CC-licensed with
                              |    a license that may be of a different type
                              |    than the ones associated with the images.
                              | 2. The primary author annotates LaTeX file to note
                              |    the type of CC license that it is intended
                              |    the be licensed under.
                              | 3. The primary author runs a compliance checking tool
                              |    on their LaTeX document to determine if their
                              |    intended license is compatible in a mash-up
                              |    with the images that are included within it.
                              | 4. The compliance checking tool reports that it
                              |    can not determine compliance because, e.g.,
                              |    it can't determine the document's intended
                              |    license or the license(s) of the mixed in
                              |    image(s).
                              | 5. The compliance checking tool reports to the
                              |    primary author that the document's intended
                              |    license is not compatible with with the
                              |    CC-licensed images that are included within it.
                              | 6. The compliance checking tool explains why
                              |    the document's intended license is not
                              |    compatabile with the CC-licensed images that
                              |    are included within it and offers possible
                              |    ways to fix the problem (e.g., remove or find
                              |    alternate images for those that are
                              |    problematic, change the document's license to
                              |    that which is less restrictive, etc.)
                              | 7. After the compliance checking tool indicates
                              |    non-compliance and indicates what might be
                              |    done to correct the situation, the primary
                              |    author may attempt to make adjustments/corrections
                              |    and re-run the compliance tool.
------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
Pre-conditions of use case:   | The primary author may not know for certain
                              | whether or not the mash-up document with its
                              | intended license is compatible with the third-party
                              | CC-licensed images that are included within it.
------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
Post-conditions of use case:  | The primary author will know whether or not the
                              | document and its intended license is compatible
                              | with the CC-licensed images that are included
                              | within it.  If the document is not comptible with
                              | its intended license, the primary author will
                              | why it is not compliant and what might be done to
                              | correct the compliance issue.
