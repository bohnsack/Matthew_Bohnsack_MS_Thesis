RDF:

1) Intro on from RP 

1.5) All RDF references from RP intro

2) Graphs of nodes

3) subject, predicate, object

4) formats: turtle, N3, N-tripple, RDF/XML (normative).

5) Example (need to reference W3schools RDF tutorial):

<?xml version="1.0"?>

<rdf:RDF
 xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
 xmlns:ex="http://bohnsack.github.com/rdf/">

 <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://bohnsack.github.com/">
   <ex:author>Matthew Paul Bohnsack</ex:author>
   <ex:title>Matthew Bohnsack's Homepage</ex:title>
 </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

Property: is a Resource that has a name, such as "author"
Property value: is the value of a property, such as "Matthew Paul Bohnsack", but note that this could also be a URI that points elsewhere

A combination of resource, property, and property value form a statement.  They are the subject, predicate, and object of a statement.

From this example, we can derive two statements:

"The author of http://bohnsack.github.com/ is Matthew Bohnsack":
    - subject: http://bohnsack.github.com/
    - predicate: author
    - object: Matthew Bohnsack

"The title of http://bohnsack.github.com/ is Matthew Bohnsack's Homepage":
    - subject: http://bohnsack.github.com/
    - predicate: title
    - object: Matthew Bohnsack's Homepage

See validator and graph pictures

The graph is called an nodes-and-arcs diagram.

Not for paper except for an overview, but: a) properties can also be defined as
attributes (instead of elements), b) property elements can also be defined as
resources, c) Bag, d) Seq, e) Alt, f) Collection, g) List, etc.

RDF Schema (RDFS) to describe application-specific classes and properties, subclass of, etc.

Dublin Core is a set of predefined properties for describing documents.

Property    Definition
Contributor An entity responsible for making contributions to the content of the resource
Coverage    The extent or scope of the content of the resource
Creator     An entity primarily responsible for making the content of the resource
Format      The physical or digital manifestation of the resource
Date        A date of an event in the lifecycle of the resource
Description An account of the content of the resource
Identifier  An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context
Language    A language of the intellectual content of the resource
Publisher   An entity responsible for making the resource available
Relation    A reference to a related resource
Rights      Information about rights held in and over the resource
Source      A Reference to a resource from which the present resource is derived
Subject     A topic of the content of the resource
Title       A name given to the resource
Type        The nature or genre of the content of the resource

Maybe a Dublin Core example

OWL: Web Ontology Language built on top of RDF.  XML for computers, not humans.

Ontology is exact description of things and their relationships.

OWL and RDF are much of the same thing, but OWL is a stronger language with greater machine interpretability than RDF.

OWL comes with a larger vocabulary and stronger syntax than RDF.

OWL Sublanguages

OWL has three sublanguages:

OWL Lite
OWL DL (includes OWL Lite)
OWL Full (includes OWL DL)

RDF uses URIs as the basis of its mechanism for identifying subjects,
predicates, and objects in statements.  Objects in RDF can be either URIrefs or
constant values (called literals).

Can also do the above example in tripples:

<http://bohnsack.github.com/> <http://bohnsack.github.com/rdf/author> "Matthew Paul Bohnsack" .
<http://bohnsack.github.com/> <http://bohnsack.github.com/rdf/title> "Matthew Bohnsack's Homepage" .

The RDF Vocabulary Description Language

namespace and vocabulary

common vocabularies include Dublin Core (already discussed), foaf (friend of a friend), and others.


RDF can only represent binary relationships.  Where we need 1-to-n, we can use blank nodes.

Blank nodes have other uses.  E.g., refer to something that doesn't have a good URI.  It then means "there is a resource".

RDF offers typed literals

exstaff:85740 exterms:age "27"^^xsd:integer .

    - set of values (value space)
    - set of character strings (lexical space)
    - lexical-to-value mapping

rdf:type

- containers: rdf:Bag, rdf: Seq, rdf:Alt

- At containers frequently used in conjunction with language tagging.  RDF/XML
  permits the use of the xml:lang attribute to indicate that the element
  content is in a specified language.  Usded fir a work whose title has been
  translated into several languages might have its title property pointing to
  an Alt 

- Not constructing containers as in a programming language.  Instead describing
  containers.

- rdf:li vis rdf:_2

- rdf:parseType="Collection" - ordered lists

- Reification: talk about who provided a particular piece of information: rdf:Statement, rdf:Subject, rdf:predicate, rdf:object
    - reification quad
    - using rdf:ID
    - might not be as rich as you think

- structured values.  See example 21.

- 4.5 XML Literals

- 5.0 Defining RDF Vocabularies: RDF Schema

    - Type system for RDF, but don't think of it as rigid as e.g., the type system in Java or even Ruby.
    - Provides facilites to describe classes and properties such as ex:Person
      and ex:jobTitle and to indicate which classes and properties are expected
      to be used together.
    - Allows resources to be defined as instances of one or more classes
    - Allows classes to be arranged in a hierarchical fashion.  e.g., class ex:Dog is subclass of ex:Mammal
    - Schemas are still RDF graphs
    - To understand additional meanings for RDF schema vocabulary, RDF software must process rdf: vocabulary + rdfs: vocabulary
    - Convention that classes start with uppercase letter, but property and
      instance names are written with initial lowercase letter.
    - examples from paper: a) classes, b) properties
    - properties: rdfs:range, rdfs:domain
        - ranges has point to both classes (and multiple classes) and and indicate that the value of a property is given by a typed literal
        - rdfs:domain property is used to indicate that a particualr property applies to a designated class
    - other:
        - cardinality constraints
        - specifying if properties are transitive
        - specifying that a given property is a unique identifier
        - specifying that two different classes actually represent the same class
        - specifying that two different instances actually represent the same individual
        - specifying constraints on the range or cardinality of a property that
          depend on the calss of resource to which a property is applied.
          e.g., being able to say that for a soccer team the ex:hasPlayers
          proptery has 11 values, while for a basketball teams the same
          property should have only 5 values.
        - ability to describe new classes in terms of combinates (unions and intersections) of other classes.
    - In addtion to the cabibilities described above, onlology languages like
      OWL which are based on RDF and RDF Schema can provide additional
      machine-processable semantics for resources, that is, to make the machine
      representations of resources moer closely resemble their intended real
      world counterparts.
