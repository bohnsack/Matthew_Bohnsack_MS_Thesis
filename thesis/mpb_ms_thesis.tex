\begin{abstract}
The Creative Commons provides legal and technical infrastructure that allows
intellectual property to be shared in terms that are more flexible than the
default ``all rights reserved''.  Under Creative Commons licenses, content can
be distributed widely online, but still controlled with specific,
well-understood common terms, such that authors reserve some rights.  More and
more content is being shared online under Creative Commons licenses.  As such,
it is very easy to create mash-ups or derivative works, based on many different
assets licensed under different Creative Commons licenses.  What's not so easy
is to pick a license compatible with all the different licenses inside of a
derivative work or to make sure all the licenses in a derivative work are
compatible with each other.

This paper looks at the conceptual and technical foundations of the Creative
Commons, takes a survey of how these things are commonly used on the Internet
today, and proposes an architecture, including usage management, that can be
used to make Creative Commons more effective.  An implementation of the proposed
architecture is presented along with a discussion on new functionality and future
work it could enable.

Creative commons is being used more and more on the web.  For example, the
popular photo- and video-sharing site Flickr has published a case-study
claiming that they were hosting over 200 million CC licensed images as of
October 2011.\cite{NEEDED}  In March of 2010, Creative Commons published a
graph of the number of CC licensed images on Flickr.\cite{NEEDED}  This graph
showing growth from 2006 to 2010 is reproduced in
figure~\ref{fi:CC-growth-on-Flickr} on page~\pageref{fi:CC-growth-on-Flickr}.

\end{figure}

This is an incredible number of images, and Flickr is not the only place that
CC licensed content can be found on the Internet.  A more detailed look at CC
content on the Internet is given in Section~\ref{section:intro:cconi}.

With all the images, video, text and other content that can be found on the web
under different CC licenses, it is very each for make a mash-up document
containing ``found content''.  However, it is not so easy to make sure you are
following all the rules when you create derivative works (mash-ups).  If you
combine dozens or even hundreds of assets together, each of which might have a
slightly different Creative Commons license, how can you ensure that your
intended use is 100\% compliant with all of the licensed content?  Further, if
an asset you want to use has a license incompatible with your intended use, is
there an easy way for you to acquire an alternative license that lets you use
the asset in the way you want to?

\subsection{Overview}\label{section:intro:cc:overview}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that provides free,
easy-to-use legal tools that provide a simple, standardized way to pre-clear
usage rights to creative works for copyright owners.  It gives copyright
holders an easy way to license their works in a way that leaves ``some rights
reserved'' as compared to the ``all rights reserved'' default.  By providing
these legal tools, the Creative Commons hopes to increase the amount of
creativity available ``in the commons''.  These licenses are not an alternative
to copyright.  Instead they apply on top of copyright, clarifying which rights
are extended to others and which rights are retained by the authors, under
their copyrights.

The Creative Commons provides detailed guidelines for annotating text, images,
audio, and video, to clearly specify how content is licensed, with a small
common set of relatively easy to understand licenses.  They also provide
guidelines for publishing via file sharing and social networking sites.  Some
support is provided for embedding license information as meta-data within
digital files.  The architecture presented in this paper makes extensive use of
the electronic embedding of license information in files.

It is important to understand a few other things about Creative Commons.
Firstly content licensed under Creative Commons licenses is not changeable or
revocable.  That is, once someone has received a copy of some CC-licensed
content, the work is perpetually licensed under the license it was received
under.  Secondly, view is always permissible under CC.  In other words, no CC
license prevents someone from viewing, reading, or listening to the CC-licensed
content.  Secondly, non-exclusive CC licenses are possible.  This means, for
example, that a particular piece of content may be licensed to the general
public in a way that is relatively restrictive, but if someone wanted a less
restrictive license, they could negotiate with the copyright holder for a
different license.

\subsection{License Types}\label{section:intro:cc:license types}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Seven main license types are defined by Creative Commons:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Public Domain}:

  This license doesn't put any restrictions on how others may remix, tweak, or
  build upon your work.

  \item \emph{Attribution}:

  This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work,
  even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This
  is the most accommodating of the licenses offered.  It is recommended for
  maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.

  \item \emph{Attribution, Share-Alike}:

  This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for
  commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new
  creations under the identical terms.  This license is often compared to free
  and open source software licenses.  All new works based on yours will carry
  the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use.

  \item \emph{Attribution, No-Derivatives}:

  This license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as
  long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you.

  \item \emph{Attribution, Non-Commercial}:

  This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work
  non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be
  non-commercial, they don't have to license their derivative works on the same
  terms.

  \item \emph{Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share-Alike}:

  This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work
  non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations
  under the identical terms.

  \item \emph{Attribution, Non-Commercial, No-Derivatives}:

  This license is the most restrictive of the licenses, only allowing others to
  download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but
  they can't change them in any way or use them commercially.
\end{enumerate}

All of the six non-Public Domain licenses can be made non-exclusive with
``CC+''\cite{NEEDED}.  This provides an explicit mechanism by which a
CC-licensed work can be marked up to express that different custom license
terms can be negotiated and how the author might be contacted to start such
negotiation.
